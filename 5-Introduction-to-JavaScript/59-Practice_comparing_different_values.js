// Practiced using the equality and strict equality operators. Also learned that you can determine the type of a variable by running "typeof" on the values

// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
compareEquality(10, "10");
