// Learned about objects and how they're similar to arrays but instead of using indexcies to access data you use properties
// Objects are useful for storing data in a structured ways

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "DogMeat",
  "legs": 13,
  "tails": 7,
  "friends": ["everyone", "anyone who gives pets"]



};
