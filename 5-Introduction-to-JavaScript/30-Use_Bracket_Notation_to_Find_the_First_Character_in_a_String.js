// Learned that JavaScript starts counting at 0 in what is known as zero-index counting and how to determine the character at a specific location through bracket notation

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
